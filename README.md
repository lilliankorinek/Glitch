# Glitch
What? Glitch is an audio-visual performance art piece critiquing mankind’s often treacherous relationship with nature.

How? I constructed the project using Processing, Adobe Premiere, archived footage, and the Arduino (to program the interaction). After collecting over four-hundred still images from various environmental disasters, I uploaded the images and programed the Processing sketch to produce a “glitch” effect. The code for the “glitch” effect can be found on Github. Viewers were able to interact with the video through a dead plant. Users triggered the “glitch” after touching the plant. 

We decided to transform the interactive installation into a performance art piece. Deyon Smith played the role of “protective mother nature” and I played the “mischievous human.” The performance ended in an ultimate brawl and complete destruction of the plant.
